# Ezra

A native app to replace PeopleSoft's Student Center from the 1800s.

## Installation

Ezra requires a few dependencies before you can get started.

First, make sure you have [node.js](http://nodejs.org) (v0.12.2).

You'll also need Tint. Tint is the framework used to package the project as a
native application.
[Download Tint here](https://github.com/trueinteractions/tint2).

Next, clone this repo and navigate to it in your command line. Install the
packages required, and run with Tint.

    $ git clone https://github.com/ajay-gandhi/Ezra-app.git
    $ cd Ezra-app/
    $ npm install
    $ tint .
