# Ezra

A native app to replace PeopleSoft's Student Center from the 1800s.

## Installation

Because Ezra is still in development, it doesn't come packaged with any of its
dependencies. Therefore, starting the app is a short process.

First, download and install the following applications:

* the [Atom editor](https://atom.io)
* [atom-shell](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)

Next, clone this repo (or download as a zip) and navigate to it in your command
line:

    cd Ezra-app/

Install any Node.js dependencies by running:

    apm install

You're ready! Run the app by executing:

    atom-shell .

(Assuming atom-shell is installed as `atom-shell`.)
