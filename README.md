# Ezra

A native app to replace PeopleSoft's Student Center from the 1800s.

## Installation

Because Ezra is still in development, it doesn't come packaged with any of its
dependencies. Therefore, starting the app is a short process.

First, make sure you have [node.js](http://nodejs.org) (v0.12.2).

Next, clone this repo (or download as a zip) and navigate to it in your command
line. Install the packages required, and run with tint in `\bin\tint`.

    cd Ezra-app/
    npm install
    ./bin/tint ./

## Contributing
