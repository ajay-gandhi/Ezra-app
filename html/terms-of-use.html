      <p>Note that it is against Cornell's <a href="http://www.it.cornell.edu/services/netid/about/terms.cfm">
        University Policy</a> to share your NetID and password. Therefore,
        although many of the functions on this website are accessible only by
        entering your Cornell NetID and password, it is highly recommended that
        you do not do so.
        <br /><br />That being said, you take complete responsibility for
        anything that you do on this website. If you do enter your NetID and
        password, you are doing so of your own accord. You also acknowledge that
        your NetID and password will be passing through a website other than one
        owned by Cornell.

      <p class="lead">More Details</p>
      <p>Your password passes through the server when you login, but is not
        stored permanently. It is held momentarily in a temporary variable,
        which is destroyed as soon as you finish logging in.
        <br /><br />Your NetID alone is stored on the server for an extended
        amount of time. You are automatically logged out from Student Center if
        no activity occurs within 5 minutes. After this timeout your NetID is
        also removed from the server.
